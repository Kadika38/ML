- ML App
    - Manages:
        - Model
        - Feature manager
        - Data set acquisition
        - Hyperparameters
        - Model adjustment / loss compution
        - Results
    
    - Order of Operation:
        1. build base model
        2. adjust hyperparameters
        3. feed data, readjust model
        4. view results

- Model
    - just the model
    1. get weights and bias
    2. get num of features/weights
    3. get partial derivatives
