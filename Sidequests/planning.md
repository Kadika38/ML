qt.py:
    Goal: Identify whether the current can be considered a reliable vector pattern for prediction.
    This includes: Identify reliable vector patterns (i.e. if this pattern occurs, this pattern follows) and compare the current vp to these reliable options
    This requires: A vector pattern comparison method that takes into account neg/pos irregularity () - options include requiring lack of neg/pos irregularity or penalizing the difference score acquired via single vector distance comparison using a penalization adjustmant scalar

    thinking about pattern comparison and reliablity recognition:
    looks at EVERY pattern
